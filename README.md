CreateMeme is an API/a Website that get variables and return memes.

Coming soon, don't try to use it now, it won't work. The text under is just to remind me what it should look like for the api link.

How to use it:

Link example: https://gachaytb.github.io/creatememe/api/?type=(memetypelistonthewebsite)&format=(formatlistonthewebsite)&v1=(yourvariable1)&(otherqueryshere)

Python:
Use the requests library to get/send information from/to the link.

More coming soon, im still learning other languages.
